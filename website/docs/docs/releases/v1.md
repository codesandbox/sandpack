# Release v1.x

Today weâ€™re excited to announce a major release of Sandpack. It includes many feature requests and a ton of improvements to the developer experience. Here are a few highlights:

- Improve SSR support;
- Fresh design and new semantic UI tokens;
- Introduce `SandpackFileExplorer` component;
- Improvements in the surface API;

## New features

### SSR support

Sandpack uses [stitches/core](https://stitches.dev/) under the hood to generate and dedupe theme variation, ensuring a consistent and lightweight CSS output. To retrieve its style values, use the following guide to get the output in the SSR:

```jsx
import { getSandpackCssText } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

// SSR template
<style
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: getSandpackCssText() }}
  id="sandpack"
/>;
```

For further clarity, take a look at our [examples](https://github.com/codesandbox/sandpack/tree/main/examples).

### SandpackFileExplorer

We heard you, and now Sandpack has a new component to navigate through files:

<SandpackProvider template="react">
    <SandpackLayout>
        <SandpackFileExplorer />
        <SandpackCodeEditor closableTabs  />
        <SandpackPreview />
    </SandpackLayout>
</SandpackProvider>

### Theme package

To reduce the bundle size of the main package and make it possible for the community to contribute custom Sandpack themes with ease, we have detached the themes.

So it wonâ€™t be available anymore through the `@codesandbox/sandpack-react` package but `@codesandbox-sandpack-themes`.

For example:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<NestedSandpack
  setupCode={`import { Sandpack } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";
import { githubLight, sandpackDark } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-themes";`}
  nestedProps={`    theme={githubLight}`  }
  />

<br/>
<br/>

Sandpack still offers a set of predefined options:

```jsx
<Sandpack
  theme="auto" // prefer color scheme sensitive
/>
```

<br/>
<br/>

But individual values can be passed to customize the style of your `Sandpack` instance:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<NestedSandpack
  setupCode={`import { Sandpack } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";
import { githubLight } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-themes";`}
  nestedProps={`    theme={{
        ...githubLight,
        colors: {
          accent: "rebeccapurple",
        },
        syntax: {
          tag: "#006400",
          string: "rgb(255, 165, 0)",
          plain: "tomato",
        },
      }}`  }
  />

### Fresh design

We took this chance to rethink how Sandpack should fit on your website. Our amazing design team at CodeSandbox challenged themselves to come up with a solution that could fit in different layouts and contexts, but still be accessible and customizable. As a result, we created a new set of themes, icons, design tokens, and components from scratch.

<Sandpack />

### All props are type-safe

From now on `files` , `visibleFiles`, `activeFile` are type-safe:

<video autoPlay muted playsinline>
  <source src="/docs/img/v1-ts.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

#### Plus:

- New React template: supports v18;
- Fix mismatch id from server to client on the SandpackCodeEditor component;
- Getting ready to support a new feature to load sandbox from [codesandbox.io](http://codesandbox.io) ðŸ‘€;
- Fix inconsistency between dependencies prop and package json file;
- `SandpackProvider` API: it fixes a few inconsistencies, which used to lead to very common mistakes. From now on, it's very alike toÂ `Sandpack`Â API, except that for some exceptions;
- Improve error message descriptions;

## Breaking changes

- `SandpackRunner` has been deprecated because the same result can be done using theÂ `SandpackPreview`Â component;
- `customSetup.main`Â has been deprecated due to redundancy, useÂ `options.activeFile`Â instead;
- `customSetup.files`Â has been deprecated due to redundancy, useÂ `files`Â instead;
- `options.openPaths` has been deprecated, use `options.visibleFiles` instead;
- Replace `customStyle` prop to `style`;
- Deprecated `viewportSize` and `viewportOrientation` from `SandpackPreview` component;
- Deprecated `theme` on `SandpackLayout`, set the theme property on `SandpackProvider` instead;
- `SandpackLayout` no longer render `ClasserProvider` and `SandpackThemeProvider`, all context are rendered on `SandpackProvider`;

### **Migration guide**

**Surface API: Sandpack**

```jsx
// Before
<Sandpack
  customSetup={{ files: { "/src/App.vue": "" }, main: "/src/App.vue" }}
  template="vue"
/>
```

```jsx
// Now
<Sandpack
  files={{ "/src/App.vue": "" }}
  options={{ activeFile: "/src/App.vue" }}
  template="vue"
/>
```

**Surface API: SandpackProvider**

```jsx
// Before
<SandpackProvider
  activePath="/src/App.vue"
  customSetup={{ files: { "/src/App.vue": "" }, dependencies: {} }}
  template="vue"
  openPaths={["/src/App.vue"]}
/>
```

```jsx
// Now
<SandpackProvider
  customSetup={{ dependencies: {} }}
  files={{ "/src/App.vue": "" }}
  options={{
    activeFile: "/src/App.vue", // used to be activePath
    visibleFiles: ["/src/App.vue"], // used to be openPaths
  }}
  template="vue"
/>
```

**Surface API: common components**

```jsx
// Before
<SandpackStack customStyle={customStyle} />
```

```jsx
// Now
<SandpackStack style={customStyle} />
```

**Theme prop**

```jsx
// Before
<Sandpack theme="github-light" />
```

```jsx
// Now
import { githubLight } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-themes";

<Sandpack theme={githubLight} />;
```

**Theme provider**

```jsx
// Before
<SandpackProvider>
  <SandpackLayout theme="github-light">...</SandpackLayout>
</SandpackProvider>
```

```jsx
// Now
<SandpackProvider theme="github-light">
  <SandpackLayout>...</SandpackLayout>
</SandpackProvider>
```

**New theme tokens**

We created a few new additional tokens and also replaced a few existing ones. So previous schemas might need some update. Here youâ€™ll find a list of schema changes.

How to read: [from key name] â†’ [to key name]

- palette â†’ colors
  - activeText â†’ hover
  - defaultText â†’ clickable
  - inactiveText â†’ surface2
  - inactiveText â†’ disabled
  - defaultBackground â†’ surface1
  - new â†’ surface3
  - accent â†’ accent
  - errorForeground â†’ error
  - errorBackground â†’ errorSurface
