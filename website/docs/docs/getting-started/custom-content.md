# Custom Content

The `Sandpack` component that you used in the previous section is called a `preset`. It wraps all the individual components and provides some smart defaults.

Presets were designed to ease the adoption of `sandpack`, while offering extensive configurability. The first thing we are looking at is how to configure the content that runs inside `sandpack`.

## Template

Your `Sandpack` instance can start with a predefined `template`. A template is is a
collection of `files` and `dependencies`, a basic starter for a sandbox, if you want.
The `vue` template in this instance, has the starter files generated by the `vue-cli`.

```jsx
<Sandpack template="vue" />
```

```js sandpack template=vue
```

The template prop accepts a string and has the following valid options: `react`, `vue`, `vue3`, `angular` and `vanilla`. If the template prop is invalid, it default to `vanilla`.

```jsx
<Sandpack template="react" />
<Sandpack template="angular" />
<Sandpack template="vanilla" />

/* Also valid, defaults to vanilla */
<Sandpack />
```

## Files

In most of the cases, you will want to pass custom code to the sandpack
instance. For this, you can use the `files` prop.

The code is passed as a `string` and should be pre-formatted:

```jsx
const code = `export default function App() {
  return <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
}
`;

<Sandpack
  template="react"
  files={{
    "/App.js": code,
  }}
/>;
```

The `files` prop accepts an object, where each `key` is the **relative path** of the file in the sandbox folder
structure. Files are added on top of the `template` structure. Furthermore, the `template` is using the same type to [define the files](https://github.com/codesandbox/sandpack/blob/main/sandpack-react/src/templates/react.ts) it contains. With this in mind, you can overwrite any of the template/sandbox
files (eg: `/index.js`, `/index.css`, etc.)

:::note Leading slash
Make sure you don't omit the leading slash (`/`) when setting the file paths
:::

If you try it out, you should get something like this:

```js sandpack 
export default function App() {
  return <h1>Hello CodeSandbox!</h1>
}
```

:::info Available files
Notice that when passing the `files` prop, only the content you pass there is available in the file tabs. The other files are still bundled together, but you don't see them.
:::

### Hidden Files

Sometimes you might want to pass some custom code to `Sandpack`, but you don't want the users to see that code. For example, you might have some stylesheet that should not be editable but helps you in your examples.

Instead of passing a `string` as the value of each `file` in the `files` prop, you can pass an object. With this format the content is passed as the `code` property and you can pass additional flags
to customize the sandpack experience. For example, you can pass a `hidden` flag for files that you don't want to show to the user:

```jsx
<Sandpack
  files={{
    "/App.js": `...`,
    "/button.js": `...`,
    "/link.js": {
      code: `...`,
      hidden: true,
    },
  }}
  template="react"
/>
```

The `hidden` flag is `false` by default.

:::info
You can use the object notation only for the files which need additional flags, while the other files can be passed as a `string`.
:::

### Active File

You can also specify the `active` file, which is open in the code editor
when the component mounts. If no `active` flag is set, the first file will be active by
default:

```jsx
<Sandpack
  files={{
    '/App.js': reactCode,
    '/button.js': {
      code: buttonCode,
      active: true,
    }
    '/link.js': {
      code: linkCode,
      hidden: true,
    },
  }}
  template="react"
/>
```

:::info
The `active` flag has precendence over the `hidden` flag. So a file with both of these set as `true` will be visible.
:::

### openPaths and activePath

You can override the entire hidden/active system with two settings (`openPaths` and `activePath`) inside the
`options` prop.

The `options` prop contains a lot of other configuration fields we will talk about later.

Notice that both options require you to match the file paths inside the sandbox, so use this with caution as it can generate errors on the long term.

```jsx
<Sandpack
  template="react"
  files={{
    "/App.js": reactButtonCode,
    "/button.js": buttonCode,
  }}
  options={{
    openPaths: ["/App.js", "/button.js", "/index.js"],
    activePath: "/index.js",
  }}
/>
```

:::info
When `openPaths` or `activePath` are set, the `hidden` and `active` flags on the
`files` prop are ignored.
:::

## Custom Setup

If you want to configure **dependencies** or you need a different sandbox structure, you can use the `customSetup` prop. This prop acts like an alternative to the `template` prop, but gives you full flexibility to configure all the details of a running sandbox.

```jsx
const code = `import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown' 

export default function App() {
  return <ReactMarkdown># Hello, *CodeSandbox*!</ReactMarkdown>
}`;

<Sandpack
  template="react"
  files={{
    "/App.js": code,
  }}
  customSetup={{
    dependencies: {
      "react-markdown": "latest",
    },
  }}
/>;
```

TODO: Inject example

If both `template` and
`customSetup` are provided, the two are merged, with the `customSetup` values
having higher priority. If you don't want to start from a template, you can
specify your entire sandbox structure with the `customSetup`.

### Dependencies

Inside `customSetup` you can pass a `dependencies` object. The `key` should be the name of the package, while the value is the `version`, exactly in the same format as you would pass it inside `package.json`.

```jsx
<Sandpack
  template="react"
  files={{
    "/App.js": `...`,
  }}
  customSetup={{
    dependencies: {
      react: "17.0.2",
      "react-dom": "17.0.2",
      "react-scripts": "4.0.0",
    },
  }}
/>
```

### Entry File

Additionally, you can also specify a different `entry` file for the sandbox. The entry file is the starting point of the bundle process.

```jsx
<Sandpack
  template="react"
  files={{
    "/App.js": `...`,
  }}
  customSetup={{
    entry: "/index.js",
  }}
/>
```

:::warning
If you change the path of the entry file, make sure you control all the files that go into the bundle process, as prexisting settings in the `template` might not work anymore.
