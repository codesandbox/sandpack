# Custom UI

In this next section, you can read about all the different options for customizing the UI of the sandpack components that render inside the `Sandpack` preset.

## Theming

The overall style can be set through the `theme` prop. Once again, sandpack offers a set of predefined options, but you can also pass individual values to style your `Sandpack` instance.

### Standard Themes

Sandpack comes with some predefined themes:

To see all the themes at a glance, use [this sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/sandpack-theme-yqsmj)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<NestedSandpack nestedProps={`    // Try out the included themes below!
      theme="dark"
      // theme="light"
      // theme="github-light"
      // theme="night-owl"
      // theme="aqua-blue"
      // theme="monokai-pro"`}
/>

### Custom Theme

You can also pass a **partial** theme object that overrides properties in the
**default** theme, which is `codesandbox-light`.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<NestedSandpack nestedProps={`    theme={{
        palette: {
          accent: "rebeccapurple",
        },
        syntax: {
          tag: "#006400",
          string: "rgb(255, 165, 0)",
          plain: "tomato",
        },
      }}`}
  />

:::success Sandpack Theme Builder
You can design your own theme or customize any existing Sandpack theme presets. [Try it now! â†—](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/theme)
:::

Furthermore you can import an existing theme object and use object composition to override specific fields.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<NestedSandpack 
  setupCode={`import { Sandpack, codesandboxDarkTheme } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";
import "@codesandbox/sandpack-react/dist/index.css";`} 
  nestedProps={`    theme={{
        ...codesandboxDarkTheme,
        typography: {
          fontSize: "16px",
          bodyFont: "Arial",
        },
      }}`}
  />

## Custom Styling

Theming controls the color palette and typography, but you can also append your own custom style to existing sandpack components.

For this, sandpack uses a small package called [`classer`](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike/tree/next/packages/classer). To customize existing components, you need to map your own classes to the internal sandpack classes.

:::note
While inspecting your Sandpack instance, notice that our components have classes prefixed with `sp-`.
:::

```jsx
<Sandpack
  theme={theme}
  template="react"
  options={{
    classes: {
      "sp-wrapper": "custom-wrapper",
      "sp-layout": "custom-layout",
      "sp-tab-button": "custom-tab",
    },
  }}
/>
```

:::info
This pattern is compatible with most modern styling systems, including Tailwind, styled-components and emotion.
:::

## Visual Options

Some of the internal components of sandpack can be configured via the `options` prop.

### Navigator

By default `Sandpack` will show a refresh button in the lower part of the preview. Using `showNavigator` you can toggle on a full browser navigator component with: `back`, `forward` and `refresh buttons` as well as an input for the URL.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<NestedSandpack
  nestedProps={`    template="react"
      options={{
        showNavigator: true,
      }}`}
/>

### Tabs

File tabs are shown if more than one file is open. But you can force tabs to always be shown/hidden with the `showTabs` prop.

On top of that, the `closableTabs` prop allows you to add a small close button for each tab, which removes it from the list.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<NestedSandpack
  nestedProps={`    options={{
        showTabs: true,
        closableTabs: true,
      }}`}
/>

### Editor Settings

There are a few different props for the code editor. `showLineNumbers` and `showInlineErrors` will toggle on/off some of the elements of the editor component. By default, line numbers are shown, but errors are not highlighted inline.

`wrapContent` can be used to avoid horizontal scroll inside the code block.

One useful configuration is the height of the component. We recommend **fixed
heights**, to avoid any layout shift while the bundler is running or as you type
in the editor or switch the tab. By default, the height is set to `300px`, but
you can adjust that with the `editorHeight` prop.

Finally, you can specify the distribution between the width of the editor and that of the preview. The `SandpackLayout` component arranges the two in a flex layout, distributing the space between the editor and the preview according to this prop. A value of 60 for the `editorWidthPercentage` will mean the `Preview` gets 40% of the space.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<NestedSandpack
  nestedProps={`    options={{
        showLineNumbers: false, // default - true
        showInlineErrors: true, // default - false
        wrapContent: true, // default - false
        editorHeight: 350, // default - 300
        editorWidthPercentage: 60, // default - 50
      }}`}
/>

### Autorun

By default, the bundling process will start as soon as the component is getting
closer to the viewport, or when the page loads, if the component is already in
the viewport. But you can allow users to trigger the process manually.

When a `sandpack` instance is not set on `autorun`, which is the default
setting, it will show a `Run` button that initializes the bundling process. This can be handy in situations in which you don't want multiple sandpack instances to run everytime the user loads the page.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<NestedSandpack
  nestedProps={`    template="react"
      options={{
        autorun: false
      }}`}
/>

### Recompile Mode

The `recompileMode` option also allows you configure what happens when the user starts typing in the code editor. The `immediate` mode will fire the change to the bundler as soon as it is received, while the `delayed` mode will debounce the bundler operation until the user starts typing. Optionally, you can set the delay for the debounce, which by default is `500ms`.

By default, the mode is set to `delayed` to ensures the bundler doesn't run on each keystroke. You can customize this
experience by modifying the `recompileDelay` value or by setting the
`recompileMode` to `immediate`.

```jsx
<Sandpack
  options={{
    recompileMode: "delayed",
    recompileDelay: 300,
  }}
  template="react"
/>
```

## Sandpack Runner

In all the examples so far, we used the `Sandpack` preset. As a reminder, a `preset` is a fixed configuration of sandpack
components and default settings, ready to use.

In case you want to have the bundler running and you don't want the code editing
component, you can use a `SandpackRunner` preset.

The `SandpackRunner` has some of the props we already described above:
`template`, `customSetup` and `theme`. They work exactly the same on this
preset.

However, your input will be sent through the `code` prop. This is a single
string that will replace the main file of the project.

```jsx
import { SandpackRunner } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

const code = `export default function App() {
  return <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
}`

<SandpackRunner code={code} template="react" />;
```

<SandpackRunner code={`export default function App() { return <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1> }`} template="react" />

:::note
The `main` file is also be set in the `template` or the `customSetup` and is not the same as the `entry` file. In this example, `code` will replace the `App.js` file, because that is the
**main** file in the react template. For `vue`, this would be the `App.vue` file.
:::

If you need to pass multiple files you can use the [`customSetup` prop](/getting-started/custom-content#custom-setup).

`SandpackRunner` is already powering the popular [`code-hike` library](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike), maintained by Rodrigo Pombo.
