# Introduction

React components that give you the power of editable sandboxes that run in the
browser. Powered by `Sandpack`, the online bundler used by
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/).

Sandpack is an open ecosystem of components and utilities that allow you to
compile and run modern frameworks in the browser. You can either use one of our
predefined `components` for embedding the _CodeSandbox_ experience into your
projects, or you can build your own version of `sandpack`, on top of our
standard components and utilities. As you walk through this guide, you will get
deeper into our ecosystem.
