## Values

### Accessibility

Sandpack enables creators. Nothing should stand in someone's way from expressing their ideas. Sandpack fills the gap between the complexity of publishing and expressing yourself for public visualization and collaboration.

As a result, Sandpack creates interactive code snippets to be easily integrated into any project, regardless of the development language and the user setup. Also, giving you a fully live coding experience in the browser that brings the development experience from CodeSandbox closer to the consumer of the content on your website. We believe that getting live coding experience should not be harder than this.

### Collaboration

With Sandpack, you're always one click away from opening a sandpack in CodeSandbox. This way, you can easily share bug reports, provide feedback on someone‚Äôs else sandpack, or fork your changes behind a unique URL.

### Empowerment

Sandpack gives you a painless live coding environment in minutes and lets you focus on what matters, which is expressing your ideas through coding. Sandpack components are designed to be extensible and customizable no matter what is your environment, layout, or needs. It also does everything to keep everybody in the state of the flow as the content and code are next to each other so no other tools required to play with the code.

Also, it embeds the browser bundler that powers¬†[CodeSandbox](http://codesandbox.io/)¬†and takes advantage of features like NPM dependency support, hot module reloading, error overlaying, and caching.

## Roadmap

The following represents a high-level overview of Sandpack's roadmap.

### Areas

We break our roadmap into 3 key areas: **Community, DevX, and Usability**.

#### Community

In order to grow the community and increase the adoption, we have to support more ways to consume Sandpack, regardless of the framework or the way to write a snippet of code.

#### DevX

Solve technical debts, implement new features to keep up to date with the latest releases from the community, and cover other community needs.

#### Usability

With Sandpack we strive to provide the best experience no matter where the given Sandpack is embedded, so SEO or usability is also a key part of improving the project.

### Priorities, Next up

Features, bugs, or improvements that are considered for implementation in the next few months. Besides this, we encourage you to contribute to the project and drive our roadmap through contributions.

### Planned for later

The rest of the issues that we have in mind for carry out eventually, probably later than 3-4 months from now.
