Sandpack is a component toolkit for creating live-running code editing experiences, powered by the online bundler used on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/).

It provides an open ecosystem of components and utilities that allow you to compile and run modern frameworks in the browser. You can either use one of our predefined `components` for embedding the _CodeSandbox_ experience into your projects, or you can build your own version of `sandpack`, on top of our standard components and utilities.

As you walk through this guide, you will get deeper into our ecosystem.
