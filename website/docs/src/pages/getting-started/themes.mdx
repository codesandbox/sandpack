The overall style can be set through the `theme` prop. Sandpack offers a set of predefined options, but individual values can be passed to customize the style of your `Sandpack` instance. Besides the included themes, you can also consume a set of themes from `@codesandbox/sandpack-themes`, an open-source package that contains many other themes compatible with Sandpack.

<Themes />

## Custom Theme

You can also pass a **partial** theme object that overrides properties in the
**default** theme, which is `light`.

<CodeBlock stack>
{`import { Sandpack } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Sandpack 
      theme={{
        colors: {
          accent: "rebeccapurple",
        },
        syntax: {
          tag: "#006400",
          string: "rgb(255, 165, 0)",
          plain: "tomato",
        },
      }}
    />
  );
}
`}
