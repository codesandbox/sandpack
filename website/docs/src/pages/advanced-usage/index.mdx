# Overview

If you [open a preset file](https://github.com/codesandbox/sandpack/blob/main/sandpack-react/src/presets/Sandpack.tsx) from the sandpack repository, you'll see it is made up
of smaller sandpack **components** and has limited logic for passing props to
those smaller components.

If you need a custom version of sandpack, you can opt in to use these smaller
components, which are also exported from the main package.

Before talking about the actual components, let's dive into how sandpack manages its internal state.

## Sandpack Provider

The core of sandpack is managed by the `SandpackProvider`, central point of our
architecture. The provider abstracts the functionality of `sandpack` and places
the public state values and functions on a `context` object. The `React`
components that are exported by the main package (eg: `SandpackCodeEditor`,
`SandpackPreview`) use that `context` object to communicate with `sandpack`.

<CodeBlock stack>
{`import { 
  SandpackProvider, 
  SandpackLayout, 
  SandpackPreview, 
  SandpackCodeEditor 
} from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

const CustomSandpack = () => (
  <SandpackProvider>
    <SandpackLayout>
      <SandpackCodeEditor />
      <SandpackPreview />
    </SandpackLayout>
  </SandpackProvider>
);

export default () => <CustomSandpack />
`}
</CodeBlock>

Running this snippet will render a preview with a vanilla template, because the sandpack logic is running behind
the scenes and the template, if omitted, is `vanilla`.

### Clients

Under one Sandpack provider, you can have multiple `sandpack-clients`. For example, the most common case for multiple clients is when more than one `SandpackPreview` has been rendered.

To access all the clients or to pass messages to the iframes under the same provider, use the `useSandpack` hook, which gives a way to interact with these clients:

```js
const ListenerIframeMessage = () => {
  const { sandpack } = useSandpack();

  const sender = () => {
    Object.values(sandpack.clients).forEach((client) => {
      client.iframe.contentWindow.postMessage("Hello world", "*");
    });
  };

  return <button onClick={sender}>Send message</button>;
};
```
