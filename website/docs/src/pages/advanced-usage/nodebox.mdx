Nodebox is a runtime for executing Node.js code in the browser. Sandpack 2.0 uses Nodebox to run server-side examples directly in the browser. For example, you can run a Vite template such as React and Vue directly on your website.

You can use Nodebox as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codesandbox/nodebox) or together with [Sandpack 2.0](/getting-started).

## Server-side support

Nodebox with out-of-the-box support for Next.js, Vite and Astro, but we’re growing to support just about any server-side framework you can imagine.

However, bear in mind it can’t run napi or any other low-level C++/Rust package you can use in Node.js—only WebAssembly and JavaScript modules. Postgres, MongoDB and MySQL are also currently not supported because of the lack of raw socket support in browsers.


## Difference with WebContainers

Web Containers use modern browser technologies like `SharedArrayBuffer`, which makes it impossible to run in Safari and requires the user to set additional `Cross-Origin-Isolation` headers on the server to run any code.

Nodebox however, is implemented without modern browser technologies, to make it run in any browser (like iOS and Safari) with minimal setup.

For further details, check the [Nodebox FAQ](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/resources/faq#how-does-the-nodebox-compare-to-webcontainers).

## Install Nodebox

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn"]}>
  <Tab>  
```shell
npm i @codesandbox/nodebox
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
```bash
yarn add @codesandbox/nodebox
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Configure and connect

To set up Nodebox, we have to provide a reference to an `<iframe>` element where the application's preview will be rendered.


```js
import { Nodebox } from '@codesandbox/nodebox';

const emulator = new Nodebox({
  iframe: document.getElementById('preview'),
});

await emulator.connect();
```

### Initialize file system

Next, populate the emulator's file system with your project files.

In this example, we will be running a simple HTTP server written in the `index.js` module.

```js
await emulator.fs.init({
  'package.json': JSON.stringify({
    name: 'my-app',
  }),
  'index.js': `
import http from 'http'

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {
    'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
  })
  res.write('Hello world')
  res.end()
})

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is ready!')
})
  `,
});
```

> You can reference built-in Node.js modules, as well as external dependencies while writing your project files.

### Run project

To run our project we need to execute the `index.js` module. Let's create a new shell and execute it there:

```js
const shell = emulator.shell.create();
await shell.runCommand('node', ['index.js']);
```

> You can use the same `shell` to control the process it's running (e.g. observe its `stdout`/`stderr`, terminate or restart it).
