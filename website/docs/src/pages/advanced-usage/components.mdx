# Components

Several `Sandpack` prefixed components are available in the `sandpack-react` package. They can be used to build custom presets, as long as they render within the providers we talked about during the previous section.

Let's try to rebuild the `Sandpack` preset, using the sandpack components available in the `sandpack-react` package.

## Layout

The first component inside the `Provider` is `SandpackLayout`. This component ensures the theming is applied and gives your sandpack instance the two column layout with the first child on the left and the second one on the right.

<Callout>
  `SandpackLayout` gives you the left-right split between two components and
  also breaks the columns when the component is under 700px wide, so you have
  some responsiveness built-in. It also renders the theme provider for
  convenience.
</Callout>

<CodeBlock stack>
{`import {
  SandpackProvider,
  SandpackLayout,
  SandpackCodeEditor,
  SandpackPreview,
} from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

export default () => (
  <SandpackProvider template="react">
    <SandpackLayout>
      <SandpackCodeEditor />
      <SandpackPreview />
    </SandpackLayout>
  </SandpackProvider>
);
`}
</CodeBlock>

Further now we have pretty much the same component as the preset, minus the prop
passing, which you can decide based on your specific needs.

You can easily swap the two components inside the `SandpackLayout` to get a different instance of `Sandpack`.

<CodeBlock stack>
{`import {
  SandpackProvider,
  SandpackLayout,
  SandpackCodeEditor,
  SandpackPreview,
} from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

export default () => (
  <SandpackProvider template="react">
    <SandpackLayout>
      <SandpackPreview />
      <SandpackCodeEditor />
    </SandpackLayout>
  </SandpackProvider>
);
`}
</CodeBlock>

`SandpackLayout` accepts a `theme` prop, so you can pass in your [custom theme object or a predefined theme](/themes).

## Preview

The `Preview` component is running the `sandpack` bundler, so without rendering a Preview component you will not have any bundling and evaluation of the code in `sandpack`. However, the `Preview` is smart enough to start even if it is mounted later in the page. This is how the `autorun=false` mode is working.

```jsx
<SandpackProvider template="react">
  <SandpackLayout>
    <SandpackPreview />
  </SandpackLayout>
</SandpackProvider>
```

There's nothing stopping you from rendering multiple previews in the same `Provider`. They will all be connected to the same state source, but they can for example point to different pages of the same application.

<CodeBlock stack>
{`import {
  SandpackProvider,
  SandpackLayout,
  SandpackPreview,
} from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

export default () => (
  <SandpackProvider template="react">
    <SandpackLayout>
      <SandpackPreview />
      <SandpackPreview />
      <SandpackPreview />
      <SandpackPreview />
    </SandpackLayout>
  </SandpackProvider>
);
`}
</CodeBlock>

<details>
  
  <summary>Options</summary>
  
| Prop | Type | Default |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `showNavigator` | `boolean` | `false`|
| `showOpenInCodeSandbox`| `boolean` | `true` |
| `showRefreshButton`| `boolean` | `true` |
| `showSandpackErrorOverlay`| `boolean` | `true` |
| `showOpenNewtab` | `boolean` | `true` |
| `actionsChildren` | JSX.Element | `null` | 
  
</details>

### Additional buttons

The `<SandpackPreview />` component also allows you to add additional buttons to the preview area.

<CodeBlock stack>
{`import {
  SandpackProvider,
  SandpackLayout,
  SandpackCodeEditor,
  SandpackPreview,
} from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

export default () => (
  <SandpackProvider template="react">
    <SandpackLayout>
      <SandpackPreview
        actionsChildren={
          <button onClick={() => window.alert("Bug reported!")}>
            Report bug
          </button>
        }
      />
      <SandpackCodeEditor />
    </SandpackLayout>
  </SandpackProvider>
);
`}
</CodeBlock>

### Additional content

For advanced use cases, children of `<SandpackPreview>` are rendered at the end of the preview container.

### Getting the client instance from SandpackPreview

You can imperatively retrieve the Sandpack client from a SandpackPreview ref, and also consume or interact with the current state of the preview. Check out the [type definitions](/api/react/interfaces/SandpackPreviewRef) for more details.

```jsx
import { SandpackPreviewRef, useSandpack, SandpackPreview } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react"

const SandpackPreviewClient: React.FC = () => {
  const { sandpack } = useSandpack();
  const previewRef = React.useRef<SandpackPreviewRef>();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const client = previewRef.current?.getClient();
    const clientId = previewRef.current?.clientId;

    if (client && clientId) {
      console.log(client);
      console.log(sandpack.clients[clientId]);
    }
  /**
   * NOTE: In order to make sure that the client will be available
   * use the whole `sandpack` object as a dependencie.
   */
  }, [sandpack]);

  return <SandpackPreview ref={previewRef} />;
};
```

<Callout>
  Worth mentioning that the SandpackClient will not be instantly available.
  Sandpack has its own rules to decide when it'is the "right" moment to
  initialize an instance from a preview component. (Sandpack will take into
  account properties such as autorun, initMode, and the current client stack
  priority) This means that it's expected that `getClient` function returns
  `undefined` which is a valid state.
</Callout>

## Code editor

The `SandpackCodeEditor` component renders a wrapper over [`codemirror`](https://github.com/codemirror/codemirror.next), a lightweight code editor we use inside `sandpack`. If you played with the `Sandpack` preset, you should be familiar already with the props that you can pass to the code editor component:

<CodeBlock stack>
{`import {
  SandpackProvider,
  SandpackLayout,
  SandpackPreview,
  SandpackCodeEditor,
} from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

export default () => (
  <SandpackProvider template="react">
    <SandpackLayout>
      <SandpackCodeEditor
        showTabs
        showLineNumbers={false}
        showInlineErrors
        wrapContent
        closableTabs
      />
      <SandpackPreview />
    </SandpackLayout>
  </SandpackProvider>
);
`}
</CodeBlock>

<details>
  <summary>Options</summary>

| Prop | Description      | Type  | Default     |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| `showTabs`            | | `boolean` | `false` |
| `showLineNumbers`     | | `boolean` | `false` |
| `showInlineErrors`    | | `boolean` | `false` |
| `showRunButton`       | | `boolean` | `false` |
| `wrapContent`         | | `boolean` | `false` |
| `closableTabs`        | | `boolean` | `false` |
| `initMode`            | This provides a way to control how some components are going to be initialized on the page. The CodeEditor and the Preview components are quite expensive and might overload the memory usage, so this gives a certain control of when to initialize them. | `"immediate" \| "lazy" \| "user-visible"` | `"lazy"`    |
| `extensions`          | CodeMirror extensions for the editor state, which can provide extra features and functionalities to the editor component.    | `Extension[]`           | `undefined` |
| `extensionsKeymap`    | Property to register CodeMirror extension keymap.    | `KeyBinding[]`          | `undefined  |
| `id`| By default, Sandpack generates a random value to use as an id. Use this to override this value if you need predictable values.                 | `string`                | `undefined` |
| `readOnly`            | This disables editing of the editor content by the user.               | `boolean`               | `false`     |
| `showReadOnly`        | Controls the visibility of Read-only label, which will only appears when `readOnly` is `true`              | `boolean`               | `true`      |
| `additionalLanguages` | Provides a way to add custom language modes by supplying a language type, applicable file extensions, and a LanguageSupport instance for that syntax mode        | `CustomLanguage[]`      | `undefined` |

</details>

### Extensions

Sandpack uses CodeMirror under the hood to provide a nice editor. You can extend the editor with any CodeMirror extensions, such as [`@codemirror/autocomplete`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codemirror/autocomplete).

<CodeBlock stack>
{`import { 
  Sandpack, 
  SandpackProvider, 
  SandpackLayout, 
  SandpackCodeEditor 
} from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";
import { autocompletion, completionKeymap } from "@codemirror/autocomplete";

export default () => (
  <SandpackProvider template="react">
    <SandpackLayout>
      <SandpackCodeEditor
        extensions={[autocompletion()]}
        extensionsKeymap={[completionKeymap]}
      />
    </SandpackLayout> 
  </SandpackProvider>
);`}
</CodeBlock>

### Additional languages

Sandpack provides built-in support for a variety of common languages:

- JavaScript, JSX
- TypeScript, TSX
- CSS, SCSS, Less
- HTML
- Vue

When an appropriate language can't be detected JavaScript is used.

If you want to support additional languages you can extend the editor by supplying a [CodeMirror language](https://github.com/orgs/codemirror/repositories?q=language&type=source) and associating it with one or more file extensions.

```jsx
import { python } from "@codemirror/lang-python";

<SandpackProvider>
  <SandpackCodeEditor
    additionalLanguages={[
      {
        name: "python",
        extensions: ["py"],
        language: python(),
      },
    ]}
  />
</SandpackProvider>

<Sandpack
  options={{
    codeEditor: {
      additionalLanguages: [
        {
          name: "python",
          extensions: ["py"],
          language: python(),
        },
      ]
    },
  }}
  template="react"
/>
```

When using a [stream language mode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codemirror/legacy-modes) you'll need to convert it into a `LanguageSupport` instance.

```jsx
import { LanguageSupport, StreamLanguage } from "@codemirror/language";
import { shell } from "@codemirror/legacy-modes/mode/shell";

<SandpackProvider>
  <SandpackCodeEditor
    additionalLanguages={[
      {
        name: "shell",
        extensions: ["sh", "bat", "ps1"],
        language: new LanguageSupport(StreamLanguage.define(shell)),
      },
    ]}
  />
</SandpackProvider>;
```

### Advanced usage

If you want to interact directly with CodeMirror, use the component ref to access the `getCodemirror` function, which will return the CodeMirror instance. Check out how to use it:

```jsx
import { EditorSelection } from "@codemirror/state";

const App = () => {
  const codemirrorInstance = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Getting CodeMirror instance
    const cmInstance = codemirrorInstance.current.getCodemirror();

    if (!cmInstance) return;

    // Current position
    const currentPosition = cmInstance.state.selection.ranges[0].to;

    // Setting a new position
    const trans = cmInstance.state.update({
      selection: EditorSelection.cursor(currentPosition + 1),
      changes: {
        from: 0,
        to: cmInstance.state.doc.length,
        insert: code,
      },
    });

    cmInstance.update([trans]);
  }, []);

  return (
    <SandpackProvider template="react">
      <SandpackCodeEditor ref={codemirrorInstance} />
    </SandpackProvider>
  );
};
```

This is especially useful to get the cursor's current position, add custom decorators, set the selection in a specific position, etc.

## File Explorer

The `SandpackFileExplorer` provides a minimal but very powerful experience to navigate through files. You can open and close folders,  and open new files.

<CodeBlock stack>
{`import { 
  SandpackProvider, 
  SandpackLayout, 
  SandpackCodeEditor, 
  SandpackFileExplorer 
} from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

export default () => (
  <SandpackProvider template="react">
    <SandpackLayout>
      <SandpackFileExplorer />
      <SandpackCodeEditor />
    </SandpackLayout>
  </SandpackProvider>
);
`}
</CodeBlock>


<details>
  <summary>Options</summary>
  
| Prop              | Description            | Type | Default |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--- | :------ |
| `autoHiddenFiles` | Enable auto hidden file in file explorer |
| `boolean`         | `false`                                  |

</details>

## Tests

The `SandpackTests` component renders a thin wrapper around [`Jest`](https://jestjs.io/) to run tests directly in the browser. This means you can run tests but additional configuration may not possible given the browser environment.

<Callout>
  Any test files ending with `.test.js(x)`, `.spec.js(x)`, `.test.ts(x)` and
  `.spec.ts(x)` will automatically be run with Jest and the results shown in the
  `SandpackTests` component.
</Callout>

### Usage

There are two ways to run tests and check out the output:

#### Sandpack Preset

Using `test-ts` template preset, which contains an example test.

<CodeBlock stack>
{`import { Sandpack } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

export default () => <Sandpack template="test-ts" />;
`}
</CodeBlock>

#### SandpackTests component

Standalone and configurable component to run tests, which you can combine with `test-ts` template or supply custom files. For more details about its usage and implementation, check out the [API reference](/api/react/#sandpacktests).

<CodeBlock stack>
{`import { 
  SandpackProvider, 
  SandpackLayout, 
  SandpackCodeEditor, 
  SandpackTests 
} from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

export default () => (
  <SandpackProvider template="test-ts">
    <SandpackLayout>
      <SandpackTests />
      <SandpackCodeEditor />
    </SandpackLayout>
  </SandpackProvider>
);
`}
</CodeBlock>

<details>
  <summary>Options</summary>

| Prop | Description      | Type  | Default     |
| `verbose` | Display individual test results with the test suite hierarchy. | `boolean` | `false`| 
| `watchMode` | Watch files for changes and rerun all tests. Note if changing a test file then the current file will run on it's own | `boolean` | `true` |
| `onComplete` | A callback that is invoked with the completed specs. | Function | `undefined` |

</details>

### Extending expect

<Callout>
  Although not all configuration is supported, [extending
  expect](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#expectextendmatchers) with custom /
  third party matchers is still possible.
</Callout>

Add the matchers either as a dependency or as a file and then import the matchers into your tests and invoke `expect.extend` with your matchers.

<CodeBlock stack>
{`import { 
  SandpackProvider, 
  SandpackLayout, 
  SandpackCodeEditor, 
  SandpackTests 
} from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

const extendedTest = \`import * as matchers from 'jest-extended';
import { add } from './add';

expect.extend(matchers);

describe('jest-extended matchers are supported', () => {
  test('adding two positive integers yields a positive integer', () => {
    expect(add(1, 2)).toBePositive();
  });
});
\`;

export default () => (
  <SandpackProvider
    customSetup={{ dependencies: { "jest-extended": "^3.0.2" } }}
    files={{ "/extended.test.ts": extendedTest }}
    template="test-ts"
  >
    <SandpackLayout>
      <SandpackCodeEditor />
      <SandpackTests />
    </SandpackLayout>
  </SandpackProvider>
);
`}
</CodeBlock>

## Console

`SandpackConsole` is a Sandpack devtool that allows printing the console logs from a Sandpack client. It is designed to be a light version of a browser console, which means that it's limited to a set of common use cases you may encounter when coding.

Sandpack runs the console directly into the iframe. As a result, all console messages pass through the Sandpack protocol, where you can attach a listener to these messages in your own component or use the proper Sandpack React hook to consume them.

### Usage

There are three ways to print the logs:

- `<Sandpack options={{ showConsole: true }} />`: shows a panel right after the `SandpackPreview`;
- `<SandpackConsole />`: standalone component to render the logs;
- `useSandpackConsole`: React hook to consume the console logs from a Sandpack client;



<CodeBlock stack>
{`import { Sandpack } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

export default () => (
  <Sandpack
    options={{
      showConsole: true,
      showConsoleButton: true,
    }}
  />
);
`}
</CodeBlock>

<details>
  <summary>`SandpackConsole` Options</summary>

| Prop | Type  | Default | Description | 
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| `clientId` | `string` | `undefined` | |
| `showHeader` | `boolean` | `true` | |
| `showSyntaxError` | `boolean` | `false` | |
| `maxMessageCount` | `number` | `800` | |
| `onLogsChange` | `(logs: SandpackConsoleData) => void` | | |
| `resetOnPreviewRestart` | `boolean` | `false` | Reset the console list on every preview restart |
| `ref` | `SandpackConsoleRef` | `SandpackConsoleRef` | Make possible to imperatively interact with the console component |

</details>

### Limitation

Considering that `SandpackConsole` is meant to be a light version of a browser console, there are a few limitations in its implementation in order to keep it modular and light:

- It needs to have a Sandpack client running (iframe) to execute the logs.
- It only supports four types of consoles: `info`, `warning`, `error`, and `clear`.
- It doesn't render nested objects due to recursive issues.

However, if you need to support more advanced cases, [`useSandpackConsole`](/api/react/#usesandpackconsole) hook is compatible with [console-feed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console-feed), which provides a closer browser-console experience without any of the limitations mentioned above.

## Code Viewer

For situations when you strictly want to show some code and run it in the browser, you can use the `SandpackCodeViewer` component. It looks similar to the code editor, but it renders a read-only version of `codemirror`, so users will not be able to edit the code.

<CodeBlock stack>
{`import {
  SandpackProvider,
  SandpackLayout,
  SandpackCodeEditor,
  SandpackCodeViewer,
  SandpackPreview,
} from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

export default () => (
  <SandpackProvider template="react">
    <SandpackLayout>
      <SandpackCodeViewer />
      <SandpackPreview />
    </SandpackLayout>
  </SandpackProvider>
);
`}
</CodeBlock>

<details>
  <summary>Options</summary>

| Prop | Description | Type  | Default |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| `showTabs`            | | `boolean` | `false` |
| `showLineNumbers`     | | `boolean` | `false` |
| `decorators` | Provides a way to draw or style a piece of the content. | `Decorators` | `undefined` |
| `code` | | `string` | `undefined` |
| `wrapContent`         | | `boolean` | `false` |
| `initMode`            | This provides a way to control how some components are going to be initialized on the page. The CodeEditor and the Preview components are quite expensive and might overload the memory usage, so this gives a certain control of when to initialize them. | `"immediate" \| "lazy" \| "user-visible"` | `"lazy"`    |

</details>

### CodeMirror decorations

This API provides a way to draw or style a piece of code in the editor content. You can implement it in the following ways:

- Entire line: add `className` or elements attributes to an entire line;
- Range: add `className` or elements attributes to a piece of content, given a `line`, `startColumn` and `endColumn`;

<SandpackDecorators />

## OpenInCodeSandboxButton

You can build a custom button that creates a new sandbox from the sandpack files. It will include any edits made in the Sandpack editor, so it is a great way to persist your changes. The created sandbox will open on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) in a new tab.

Let's use the `UnstyledOpenInCodeSandboxButton` as an example:

<CodeBlock stack>
{`import {
  SandpackProvider,
  SandpackLayout,
  SandpackCodeEditor,
  UnstyledOpenInCodeSandboxButton,
} from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

export default () => (
  <SandpackProvider template="react">
    <SandpackLayout>
      <SandpackCodeEditor />
    </SandpackLayout>
    
    <UnstyledOpenInCodeSandboxButton>
      Open in CodeSandbox
    </UnstyledOpenInCodeSandboxButton>
  </SandpackProvider>
);
`}
</CodeBlock>


The `UnstyledOpenInCodeSandboxButton` is a basic component that does not carry any styles. If you want a ready-to-use component, use the `OpenInCodeSandboxButton` instead, which has the same functionality but includes the CodeSandbox logo.

## Other components

You can also bring other components in the mix: `SandpackTranspiledCode`, `FileTabs`, `SandpackFileExplorer`, `Navigator` and so on.

For example, you can create an editor instance that gives you the transpiled
code of your **active** component instead of the preview page:

<CodeBlock stack>
{`import {
  SandpackProvider,
  SandpackLayout,
  SandpackCodeEditor,
  SandpackTranspiledCode,
} from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

export default () => (
  <SandpackProvider template="react">
    <SandpackLayout>
      <SandpackCodeEditor />
      <SandpackTranspiledCode />
    </SandpackLayout>
  </SandpackProvider>
)
`}
</CodeBlock>

You will notice that the theming applies to all components in the same way, as
the theme object is also distributed by the theme context.

Some of the components have configuration props that toggle subparts on/off or that configure behavior/look. All
of them comunicate with sandpack through the shared context.

<Callout icon="🎉">
**Congrats!**<br/>
You can now easily create a custom Sandpack component by reusing some of the building components of the library. The next step is to build your own sandpack components with the help of our custom hooks.
