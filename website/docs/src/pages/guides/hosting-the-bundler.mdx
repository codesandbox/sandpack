# Hosting the Bundler

<Callout>
  You can also host the bundler by yourself, all necessary files are in the
  `sandpack` folder.
</Callout>

If you want to host the bundler yourself, you will need to do a few things.

- The bundler is part of the codesandbox-client codebase: https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-client
- Clone the codesandbox-client and install the dependencies in the root folder (`yarn install`).
- `yarn build:deps` to build some of the packages lerna needs for internal links.
- create your instance of sandpack with `yarn build:sandpack`.

This creates a `www` folder in the root of `codesandbox-client`. That `www` folder is the
sandpack folder sandpack-client connects to on `{version}-sandpack.codesandbox.io`.
Once you have this hosted on your end you can pass `bundlerURL` when calling:

```js
new SandpackClient(iframe, sandboxInfo, {
  bundlerURL: "https://your-hosted-version",
});
```

or, if you use sandpack-react, you can bundlerURL in the `options` of the Sandpack preset.

### Why

There are few reasons for hosting the bundler like this, as opposed to having it exported as library code.

#### Security

The bundler evaluates and transpiles all files in an iframe under a different
subdomain. This is important, because it prevents attackers from tampering with
cookies of the host domain when evaluating code.

#### Performance

We heavily make use of Web Workers for transpilations. Almost all our
transpilation happens in web workers, and there is no easy way yet to bundle
this in a library.

#### Bundle Size

Another reason to host the bundler externally is because of code splitting: we
split all our transpilers away and load them on-demand. If a user doesn't use
`sass` we won't load the transpiler. This wouldn't be possible if we would give
one big JS file as the library.

#### Offline Support

We use Service Workers to download all transpilers in the background, so the
next time a user visits your website they don't have to download the bundler
anymore and it can be used offline. This is possible because we host the service
worker externally.
