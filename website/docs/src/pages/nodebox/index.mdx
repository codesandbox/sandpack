Nodebox is a runtime for executing Node.js code in the browser. Sandpack 2.0 uses Nodebox to run server-side examples directly in the browser. For example, you can run a Vite template such as React and Vue directly on your website.

You can use Nodebox as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codesandbox/nodebox) or together with [Sandpack 2.0](/getting-started).

## Server-side support

Nodebox with out-of-the-box support for Next.js, Vite and Astro, but we’re growing to support just about any server-side framework you can imagine.

However, bear in mind it can’t run napi or any other low-level C++/Rust package you can use in Node.js—only WebAssembly and JavaScript modules. Postgres, MongoDB and MySQL are also currently not supported because of the lack of raw socket support in browsers.


## Difference with WebContainers

Web Containers use modern browser technologies like `SharedArrayBuffer`, which makes it impossible to run in Safari and requires the user to set additional `Cross-Origin-Isolation` headers on the server to run any code.

Nodebox however, is implemented without modern browser technologies, to make it run in any browser (like iOS and Safari) with minimal setup.
