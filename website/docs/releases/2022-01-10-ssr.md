Sandpack has introduced a new API to support server-side rendering of the CSS theme and the syntax-highlight component from version TODO, as you can read more [here](/getting-started/ssr). As a result, there are some slight changes in the current Sandpack API (more specific to the theme), where you can check as follows:

## Migration guide

### CSS file import

Before, you had to explicitly import a CSS file, which contained the default styles for the component. From now on, all styles are dynamically injected into the head element, or you can retrieve it from the method described bellow.

```diff
 import { Sandpack } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";
- import "@codesandbox/sandpack-react/dist/index.css";

 <Sandpack template="react" />;
```

### Consuming CSS

Sandpack uses [stitches/core](https://stitches.dev/) under the hood to generate and dedupe theme variation, ensuring a consistent and lightweight CSS output. So in order to retrieve its style values, use the following guide to get the output in the SSR:

```jsx
import { getSandpackCssText } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";
// SSR template
<style
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: getSandpackCssText() }}
  id="sandpack"
/>;
```

Still not clear, take a look at these [examples](https://github.com/codesandbox/sandpack/tree/main/examples).

### Themes

In order to improve the consistency between the CSS variables used internally and the key names of the theme object, some of the keys have had been renamed.

```diff
const customTheme: SandpackTheme = {
-  palette: { ... },
+  colors: { ... },

-  typography: {
-    bodyFont: '"Segoe UI"',
-    monoFont: '"Fira Mono"',
-    fontSize: "14px",
+  font: {
+    body: '"Segoe UI"',
+    mono: '"Fira Mono"',
+    size: "14px",
      lineHeight: "1.4",
  },

  syntax: { ... }
}
```
